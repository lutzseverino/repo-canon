Adopting Repo Canon installs contribution and agent instructions, rules,
skills, templates, and validation workflows into a repository. This process is
called adoption, and a profile is the set of conventions it applies. Rules are
the installed requirements that a repository's files keep satisfying after
adoption.

## Installation

On macOS or Linux, use Node.js 24 or 26, npm, and Git 2.32.0 or newer. To adopt Repo
Canon, give your coding agent this prompt in your repository:

```text
Run `npx --yes @lutzseverino/repo-standards adopt https://github.com/lutzseverino/repo-canon --json` in this repository and follow what it prints.
```

[Repository Standards](https://github.com/lutzseverino/repo-standards) is the
tool that applies Repo Canon, and `npx` runs it without a separate
installation. To run it yourself, use this command in a terminal, from a clean,
committed working tree of your repository:

```sh
npx @lutzseverino/repo-standards adopt https://github.com/lutzseverino/repo-canon
```

In a terminal, `adopt` asks its questions and guides your edits. For an
agent, it prints an answers file to fill in with you and its next steps.

## Features

- Install contribution guidance, agent configuration, and issue and PR templates.
- Validate issue contracts (a change's agreed scope and acceptance criteria) and pull request metadata in GitHub workflows.
- Copy sixteen of [Matt Pocock's skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills), those the shared workflow relies on, into `.agents/skills/`.
- Ship a `triage` skill, forked from his, that routes each request by where its uncertainty lies: an independent review of its researched issue contract, or the owner's answers before one is written.
- Ship a `babysit` skill that takes an opened pull request through review to its merge.
- Offer a `factory` profile that adds factory workflow rules, configuration and the toolchain image a host-installed factory, an unattended ticket-running service, needs to serve the repository.
- Set up triage labels, squash-only merging, and a required `PR metadata` check where GitHub's plan offers one.
- Check the repository introduction, component introductions, and documentation navigation.
- Install rules for the documentation tree, the repository and component introductions, the license, and the GitHub configuration.

## Usage

Adoption installs Repo Canon's files, skills, and rules, then has you or your
agent bring the README, license, documentation, and agent instructions in line
with the rules. Your repository-specific agent instructions move to
`docs/agents/project.md`. It also sets up GitHub labels and merge rules; this
remote setup can be deferred when GitHub access is missing, so adoption
completes locally. Review the changes `adopt` leaves and commit them.

Pick the `standard` profile, or `factory` for a repository a factory serves;
the [adoption guide](docs/usage/adopt-repo-canon.md) explains the choice and
what remote setup needs. To update, read the
[release notes](https://github.com/lutzseverino/repo-canon/releases) since your
adopted release, then run the command without the URL:

```sh
npx @lutzseverino/repo-standards adopt
```

Repo Canon makes no stability promise and releases frequently. Every release,
including a breaking one, is adoptable from the previous release in one
`adopt`. Stay current by running `adopt`, or opt in to the
[scheduled update workflow](https://github.com/lutzseverino/repo-canon/issues/561)
when it is available. The [versioning guide](docs/usage/versioning.md) explains
compatibility and release notes.
